## Project Overview
In a competitive business landscape, many retailers drown in data but starve for insights, wasting time and money on guesswork instead of growth. The Global Electronic Retailer Dashboard, built in Power BI for the finance team as a Power BI Developer, fixes this by turning raw numbers into a clear, simple and interactive visual dashboard that spots trends by category, country, or month, and drives revenue with targeted actions for smart decisions.

 ## Business Meaning
 
- The consistent growth in revenue, units sold, and profit suggests effective sales strategies and market demand. Stable profit margins indicate good cost management.
- Balanced gender revenue distribution implies marketing can target both genders equally.
- Concentration in Europe and North America highlights where to focus marketing and expansion efforts, while the low Australian revenue suggests untapped potential or weaker market penetration.
- Color preferences (Black, White, Silver) reflect customer tastes, which should guide inventory and design decisions.
- The increase in orders with a slight drop in average order value suggests more low-value purchases, possibly from new or price-sensitive customers.
- Improved delivery times enhance customer satisfaction and could boost retention.
- A growing active customer base is positive, but the rising inactive percentage (22.13%) signals potential churn risk.
- Younger age groups (24-44) are more engaged, suggesting targeted retention for older demographics.
- Regional activity patterns reinforce the focus on North America and Europe for customer engagement.
- High-performing product categories (Computers, Home Appliances, Cell Phones) and specific products (desktops, televisions) highlight areas of strength to maintain or expand and prioritize stock and promotions..


## Recommendations

 - Launch gender-neutral marketing campaigns leveraging the balanced revenue split (49.18% Male, 50.82% Female).
 - Focus seasonal promotions in January and November to capitalize on revenue peaks.
 - Invest in marketing and logistics in Australia to boost its low revenue contribution (4.69%).
 - Strengthen presence in secondary markets like Canada, Italy, and the Netherlands that need further analysis.
 - Adjust pricing strategies to improve the declining average order value ($887, 0.6% decrease vs. PY).
 - Maintain or enhance delivery efficiency (4.5 days) to sustain customer satisfaction.
 - Prioritize stock and promotions for high-demand product categories (Computers, Cell Phones).
 - Develop re-engagement strategies for the 22.13% inactive customers, especially the 75-95 age group.
 - Offer loyalty incentives to the active 24-44 age segment to maintain engagement.
 - Focus customer retention efforts on North America and Europe, where active customer bases are strongest.
 - Prioritize production and marketing for high-revenue categories like Computers and Home Appliances.
 - Continue offering popular colors (Black, Silver, White, Brown) and explore limited-edition colors for lower-performing categories like Games and Toys.
 - Maintain cost efficiency to preserve the 58.58% profit margin and investigate cost-saving opportunities for moderately performing categories (e.g., Audio, Music, Movies & Audio).
